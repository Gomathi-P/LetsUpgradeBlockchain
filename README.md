1. A blockchain is a database  that is shared across a network of computers. Once a record has been added to the chain it is very difficult to change. To ensure all the copies of the database are the same, the network  makes constant checks. Blockchains have been used to underpin cyber-currencies like bitcoin, but many other possible uses are emerging.

2. Blockchain trying to solve problems like
      1.  Currency and Transaction Support.
      2.  Supply Chains and Item Histories.
      3.  Voting.
      4.  Government Operations.
      5.  Intellectual Property.
      6.  Marijuana Industry's Banking and Logistics Issues.
      7.  Cloud Storage.
      8.  Charity.
3.  The features which blockchain gives us are       
            1. Blockchain as a data structure
            2. Immutability and tamper detection in blockchain  
            3. Data protection in blockchain
            4. Distributed ledger technology
            5. Relative user anonymity
            6. Blockchain’s solution to double spending
 4.   Each block contains, among other things, the current time, a record of some or all recent transactions, and a reference to the block that came immediately before it. It also contains an answer to a difficult-to-solve mathematical puzzle - the answer to which is unique to each block.        
5. As public ledgers, Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum require transactions to be visible by default.
Ethereum network offers pseudo-anonymity; for example, transactions are linked to addresses that correspond to public keys derived by user-held private keys, not by username or password.
Certain technologies are currently being developed and tested for Ethereum 2 and Ethereum 3 that add an enclave of privacy to public Ethereum, namely, zk-SNARKs.
A zk-SNARK is a cryptographic proof system that allows users to maintain private transactions while validating the transactions according to the network’s consensus algorithm.
Once zk-SNARKs is implemented, organizations will be able to transact on the same network as their competitors in complete privacy, while enjoying the security of the public Ethereum blockchain.
Until then, enterprises can utilize public or private Ethereum to address a wide variety of use cases.
